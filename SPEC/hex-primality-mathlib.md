# hex-primality-mathlib (depends on hex-primality + Mathlib)

The Mathlib bridge for
[hex-primality](../../HexPrimality/SPEC/hex-primality.md). It identifies
`Hex.Nat.Prime` with Mathlib's `Nat.Prime`, transports the total core decision,
search, and initial-segment results, extends the bare `primality` tactic to
`Nat.Prime` goals, and provides an explicit opt-in `Nat.Prime` `norm_num`
policy.

This is not a correspondence-only layer. Its elaborators choose registrations,
dispatch between proof-producing routes, run bounded untrusted search, and
reify terms for kernel checking. This SPEC therefore owns their success,
decline, failure, resource, conformance, and proof-performance contracts.

## Ownership boundary

The core SPEC owns every Mathlib-free predicate, table, sieve, Miller--Rabin
test, certificate type, certificate search, factor-search primitive, checker,
and correctness theorem. In particular, this layer does not respecify
`primeCert?`, `rhoFactorCountedWith?`, `checkPrime`, or the core elaboration
policy. Their algorithms and bounds remain normative in
[the core API and tactic sections](../../HexPrimality/SPEC/hex-primality.md#the-api).

This SPEC owns only the Mathlib-facing correspondence and transport theorems,
the `Nat.Prime` tactic handler, the opt-in `norm_num` registrations and command,
the bridge-specific negative-result policy, and the evidence that those paths
elaborate kernel-checked proofs within their accepted budgets. A future
Mathlib-side primality dependency or additional elaborator also belongs here;
it must remain an accelerator over the core checker rather than a replacement
for the Mathlib-free proof boundary.

## Headline correctness theorem

The bridge's headline correctness theorem is
`Hex.Nat.isPrime_iff_natPrime`:

```lean
theorem Hex.Nat.isPrime_iff_natPrime {n : Nat} :
    isPrime n = true ↔ Nat.Prime n
```

It is the end-to-end post-condition for the public total decision API: the
Mathlib-free computation returns `true` exactly when Mathlib's predicate
holds. The proof-producing tactic route terminates at the separately exposed
`Hex.Nat.natPrime_of_checkPrimeAt`, whose Boolean premise is the
kernel-replayed certificate check emitted by the elaborator.

## Correspondence and transports

The whole predicate correspondence is:

```lean
theorem Hex.Nat.prime_iff {n : Nat} :
    Hex.Nat.Prime n ↔ Nat.Prime n
```

The two predicates have the same divisor characterization after unfolding
Mathlib's irreducibility packaging. Every bridge theorem transports a core
result through this equivalence; it does not introduce a second primality
argument.

The certificate, decision, compositeness, and successful-search transports
are:

```lean
theorem Hex.Nat.natPrime_of_checkPrime {c : PrimeCert}
    (h : checkPrime c = true) : Nat.Prime c.subject

theorem Hex.Nat.natPrime_of_checkPrimeAt {n : Nat} {c : PrimeCert}
    (h : (c.subject == n && checkPrime c) = true) : Nat.Prime n

theorem Hex.Nat.isPrime_iff_natPrime {n : Nat} :
    isPrime n = true ↔ Nat.Prime n

theorem Hex.Nat.millerRabin_refutes_natPrime {n a : Nat}
    (h : millerRabin n a = false) : ¬ Nat.Prime n

theorem Hex.Nat.nextPrime?_natPrime {n : Nat} {r : Rand}
    {fuel p : Nat} {r' : Rand}
    (h : nextPrime? n r fuel = .ok (p, r')) :
    n < p ∧ Nat.Prime p ∧
      ∀ q, n < q → q < p → ¬ Nat.Prime q
```

No `DecidablePred Nat.Prime` instance is declared. Mathlib's
`Nat.decidablePrime` remains the selected global instance; the bridge adds
proof transports and elaborator routes without creating instance-selection
churn.

The bounded `isPrime?` result has no separate Mathlib transport: no bridge API
consumes its explicit `Rand` and fuel plumbing. Consumers that need the
bounded verdict stay on the core API; the bridge transports only the total
`isPrime` result and the proof-producing routes listed above.

## Initial-segment transports

The committed table and range enumeration remain core data. This layer states
their results in the forms used by Mathlib consumers:

```lean
theorem Hex.Nat.primeTable_spec :
    ∀ n < primeTableBound, (n ∈ primeTable ↔ Nat.Prime n)

theorem Hex.Nat.primesIn_spec (lo hi : Nat) :
    ∀ n, n ∈ primesIn lo hi ↔ lo ≤ n ∧ n < hi ∧ Nat.Prime n

theorem Hex.Nat.filter_prime_range [DecidablePred Nat.Prime]
    {bound : Nat} (h : bound ≤ primeTableBound) :
    (Finset.range bound).filter Nat.Prime =
      (primeTable.toList.filter (fun p => p < bound)).toFinset

theorem Hex.Nat.forall_prime_lt {P : Nat → Prop} {bound : Nat}
    (hb : bound ≤ primeTableBound)
    (h : ∀ p ∈ primeTable, p < bound → P p) :
    ∀ p, p < bound → Nat.Prime p → P p
```

`filter_prime_range` exposes the complete table as a `Finset`; the
quantified `forall_prime_lt` form lets a caller discharge a property by a
decidable fold over the committed literal. Sieve generation, table
verification, and the unrestricted `primesIn` algorithm stay in the core
SPEC.

## `Nat.Prime` elaboration routes

### Bare `primality`

After importing this library, bare `primality` closes a goal whose target,
after metavariable instantiation, is syntactically `Nat.Prime n` for a closed
natural-number numeral `n`. It uses the core certificate route and emits
`natPrime_of_checkPrimeAt` applied to the reified certificate and a single
reducible Boolean equality. Compiled search is untrusted; the elaborator first
self-checks the certificate and the kernel then replays `checkPrime`.

The bridge registers its handler on the existing `primality` syntax kind.
Both handlers defer on the other predicate's goal head, so dispatch does not
depend on their registration order. A goal with any other head is declined
with `unsupportedSyntax`, after which the core handler continues to support
`Hex.Nat.Prime`. The bridge does not replace the term form
`primality n`, nor the tactic forms `primality n` and `primality h : n` that
introduce a hypothesis: those forms retain their core result type
`Hex.Nat.Prime n`.

The handler shares the core's named `withinPrimalityBudget`, `primalityFuel`,
and `primalitySearchBudget` definitions. The positive certificate input,
recursive-fuel, rho-restart, and rho-step limits therefore have one executable
and normative owner; their current values and evidence are specified in
[the core tactic contract](../../HexPrimality/SPEC/hex-primality.md#the-tactic).
The bridge must not copy those constants or silently widen them.

### Default and opt-in `norm_num`

An ordinary import retains pinned Mathlib's registered `Nat.Prime` extension,
as the default-registration conformance probe pins. Thus `norm_num` uses
Mathlib's trial-division behavior unless the current module contains:

```lean
use_hex_primality_norm_num
```

The command locally removes Mathlib's original registration. The two Hex
extensions have disjoint threshold guards: the guarded Mathlib alias handles
numerals below `natPrimeCertThreshold = 2^24`, while the certificate extension
handles numerals at and above it. Their relative registration order is
therefore immaterial. Attribute erasure does not cross an import boundary;
each importing module must opt in independently.

The threshold comes from fresh one-goal modules on the pinned toolchain. Each
arm was a fresh importing module containing only one `Nat.Prime` example. The
trial arm used the ordinary Mathlib registration; the certificate arm invoked
the opt-in with the threshold temporarily set to zero. Representative wall
times in seconds were:

| numeral | trial division | certificate |
|---:|---:|---:|
| 100003 | 1.7 | 2.1 |
| 300007 | 1.4 | 1.0 |
| 1000003 | 1.6 | 1.7 |
| 3000017 | 1.5 | 3.6 |
| 10000019 | 3.1 | 3.4 |
| 30000001 | 3.4 | 3.5 |
| 33554467 | 2.4 | 1.7 |

These are policy measurements rather than a Phase-4 performance verdict.
They locate the crossover region while showing that certificate search is
input-dependent. Mathlib's generated trial proof also exceeds the pinned
default kernel recursion limit on the 31-bit Mersenne prime. The power-of-two
boundary keeps every input of at most 24 bits on the simpler route and sends
every 25-bit input to the bounded route.

On the certificate tier, positive results use the same bounded search,
compiled self-check, reification, and kernel replay as bare `primality`.
Negative results are supported only after certificate search returns the
fixed-tier `.composite` verdict. They use the separately bounded factor route
below. Neither Hex extension invokes the total `isPrime` decision.

## Negative-result policy

For an admitted numeral `n`, certificate search starts from
`Hex.Rand.ofSeed n`. If it returns `.composite`, factor search resumes the
returned state with:

```lean
Hex.Nat.Internal.rhoFactorCountedWith? n failure.rand
  natPrimeRhoRestartBudget natPrimeRhoStepBudget
```

where `natPrimeRhoRestartBudget = 1` and
`natPrimeRhoStepBudget = 2^16` Brent cycle steps per restart throughout the
supported input range. The current root-composite preflight consumes zero
attempts and leaves the seeded state unchanged; conformance pins that fact for
deterministic replay. The factor primitive's parity preflight may return
factor `2` without consuming a restart.

Every returned candidate `d` is revalidated as `1 < d`, `d < n`, and
`n % d = 0`. Only then may Mathlib's `deriveNotPrime` construct an
independently kernel-checked proper-factor proof. A Miller--Rabin verdict
selects this branch but never appears as the emitted negative proof.

If certificate search returns `.exhausted`, negative factor search does not
run. If factor search exhausts or returns an invalid candidate, the certificate
extension declines. The guarded trial alias also declines at and above
`2^24`, so none of these outcomes starts total or unbounded trial division.
Inputs outside the core elaboration ceiling decline before certificate or
negative-factor search.

## Success, decline, failure, and timeout semantics

| entry point and condition | required outcome |
|---|---|
| bare `primality`, accepted prime numeral | close the goal with a reified, kernel-replayed certificate proof |
| bare `primality`, composite numeral | report that the numeral is not prime, including a fixed-base Miller--Rabin witness when available |
| bare `primality`, certificate exhaustion | report exact attempts, seed, selected fuel, and policy maxima; state that no total decision ran |
| bare `primality`, over-budget numeral | reject before certificate search with the supported bit ceiling |
| bare `primality`, open or non-numeral `Nat.Prime` target | report the closed-numeral requirement |
| bridge handler, non-`Nat.Prime` target | decline so the core handler or another syntax handler can run |
| default `norm_num`, any numeral | preserve pinned Mathlib registration and its total trial-division behavior; no Hex bound applies |
| opted-in `norm_num`, numeral below `2^24` | delegate to the guarded Mathlib trial extension |
| opted-in `norm_num`, certificate-tier prime | emit the checked positive certificate proof |
| opted-in `norm_num`, certificate-tier composite with a valid factor | emit the independently checked proper-factor proof |
| opted-in `norm_num`, unsupported shape, over-budget input, or bounded exhaustion | decline; if no other extension applies, leave an unsolved goal |

An internal certificate self-check failure is never converted into a proof.
Bare `primality` reports it as an internal error; the `norm_num` extension
declines.

Without the opt-in, the bounded Hex `norm_num` routes never run: the default
route inherits Mathlib's total `minFac` cost on large inputs and its generated
proof can exceed the pinned kernel recursion limit by 31 bits, as
`Conformance.lean` pins. The bounded resource contract below applies to bare
`primality` and to `norm_num` only after `use_hex_primality_norm_num`.

That contract is a **10-second absolute wall-clock gate for a fresh importing
module** on the designated benchmark host. It includes Lake
traversal, imports, compiled search and self-check, term construction, and
kernel replay. It is not an internal ten-second tactic timer and is not an
import-subtracted delta. A benchmark timeout or an ordinary Lean resource
interruption emits no proof; a row exceeding the absolute gate invalidates the
performance evidence rather than changing elaborator semantics.

## Conformance and proof-performance ownership

The bridge owns `conformance/HexPrimalityMathlib/Conformance.lean` and
`conformance/HexPrimalityMathlibConformance/OptIn.lean`. Together they cover
correspondence-facing tactic use, default registration, module-local opt-in precedence, both sides of the
`2^24` threshold, positive and negative certificate-tier results,
deterministic seed/state replay, parity without a restart, exact negative
exhaustion, the input ceiling, ordinary failure diagnostics, import-boundary
locality, and preservation of `Nat.decidablePrime`. The non-executable
correspondence and segment theorem surfaces are instantiated against the exact
inputs pinned by core conformance; bridge tests exercise their transport but
do not rerun the core computation as nominally independent evidence.

The correspondence and segment declarations (`prime_iff`, the direct result
transports, `primeTable_spec`, `primesIn_spec`, `filter_prime_range`, and
`forall_prime_lt`) are structural theorems, not executable or proof-producing
operations in either Phase-4 evidence track. Their proof bodies are compiled
once into the bridge and applying them runs neither certificate search nor a
bridge elaborator. The small conformance examples that rewrite with
`filter_prime_range` deliberately test the theorem's semantics; the ensuing
`Finset` reduction is consumer proof work over core-owned committed data, not
a bridge operation. The hypotheses cap this table-facing API at
`primeTableBound`. A future bridge tactic that performs this reduction would
be a new proof-track operation and would require matched fresh-module evidence.

Fresh importing modules under
`bench/HexPrimalityMathlib/ProofProbe/` own proof-production evidence. The
`Mathlib512`, `MathlibExhausted`, and `MathlibOverBudget` probes cover the
shared positive policy; `MathlibBaseline` is their import control. The
`Negative*` probes cover factor-found inputs at 25, 32, 64, 65, and 512 bits,
both parity and odd-factor cases, plus balanced 512-bit exhaustion.
`Negative64Null` is the elevated null control: it repeats balanced 64-bit
negative proofs so host interference is visible above the import floor.

The bridge-owned Phase-4 matrix adds `Baseline` and matched table-smooth 31-
and 512-bit `Input`, `Literal`, `Reify`, `Replay`, and `Primality` modules. `NormNumTrial`,
`NormNumThreshold`, and `NormNum512` cover the opted-in route immediately below
and above the `2^24` boundary and at the supported ceiling. The paired runner is
`scripts/bench/primality_mathlib_proof_sweep.py`; its release record is
`reports/bench-results/hex-primality-mathlib-proof-probes-issue-9765-chungus2.json`.
It does not add a bridge search probe: certificate search is byte-for-byte the
core `primeCertCountedWith?` call and remains performance-owned by
`HexPrimality`. The bridge matrix instead prices the core reifier in the
bridge's emission context together with the bridge-owned wrapper construction,
transport theorem, kernel replay, registration dispatch, and full elaboration.
The reification rows include a second elaboration of the fixed certificate
syntax and are therefore inclusive upper estimates rather than pure reifier
micro-measurements. The replay rows force the same Boolean checker with
`by decide +kernel`; they are replay proxies rather than byte-identical copies
of the elaborator's emitted `Eq.refl true` witness.

The same-input crossover measurements above establish the `2^24` policy. The
Phase-4 matrix validates its selected endpoints: the opted-in trial arm just
below the boundary had a 1.963 s median fresh-module cost, while the first
tested certificate-tier prime had a 3.621 s median and remained far below the
10 s gate. Because those rows use different numerals, their difference is not
attributed to the route alone. At 512 bits, bare `primality` and opted-in
`norm_num` had 3.777 s and 3.420 s medians; their difference is below the
matched null envelope, so the choice between those public entry points is
semantic rather than a claimed speed distinction. Keeping all inputs through
24 bits on trial division uses the simpler route throughout the selected range,
while the bounded certificate route is required above it to avoid Mathlib's
unbounded trial behavior and 31-bit kernel-depth failure.

There is `no-comparable-surface-in-named-comparator` for the bridge proof
track. No external tool emits and kernel-checks the same `Nat.Prime` proof term
through this registration, transport theorem, and pinned Lean kernel. The
transported certificate search remains performance-owned by `HexPrimality`;
it is not a second comparator for the bridge wrapper.

The positive-route harness and evidence are shared with the core policy and
are cited by the core SPEC. The bridge-specific negative harness is
`scripts/bench/primality_negative_sweep.py`. Its designated-host record,
`reports/bench-results/hex-primality-negative-policy-issue-9803-chungus2.json`,
contains six balanced samples per row. Every substantive row passes the
10-second absolute gate:

| case | bits | outcome | maximum wall time |
|---|---:|---|---:|
| first certificate-tier composite | 25 | factor found | 3.137 s |
| strong pseudoprime | 32 | factor found | 2.235 s |
| balanced semiprime | 64 | factor found | 2.286 s |
| `2^64 + 1` | 65 | factor found | 2.423 s |
| even ceiling input | 512 | parity factor found | 2.131 s |
| odd ceiling input with a 7-bit factor | 512 | factor found | 2.435 s |
| balanced ceiling semiprime | 512 | exhausted | 3.318 s |

Import-subtracted values remain diagnostic and need not resolve above the null
envelope. The baseline and elevated null controls had robust spread/build
ratios of 12.51% and 2.69%, respectively. The record reproduces with:

```bash
python3 scripts/bench/primality_negative_sweep.py --samples 6 \
  --shared-host --expected-host chungus2 --cpu 22 --timeout 30 \
  --warm-timeout 600 --max-pair-retries 32 \
  --output reports/bench-results/hex-primality-negative-policy-issue-9803-chungus2.json
```

`lake build HexPrimalityElabProbe` is the untimed build-only reproduction.

These probes are proof-performance evidence, not a claim that the layer is
correspondence-only and exempt from review. Any change to registration,
dispatch, thresholds, search budgets, reification, emitted proof shape, or
imports must refresh the affected conformance and fresh-module evidence.

## Review and attestation

Phase-2 review treats `HexPrimality` and `HexPrimalityMathlib` as distinct
libraries with distinct owned specifications. The core attestation is reviewed
against `HexPrimality/SPEC/hex-primality.md`; the bridge attestation is reviewed
against this file. A pair-level review or report must identify both SPEC owners
rather than citing the core SPEC as authority for bridge registration,
failure, resource, or evidence semantics.
